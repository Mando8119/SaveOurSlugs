# SaveOurSlugs

This is the emergency SOS app, Save Our Slugs! This was a hackthon project created by 4 UCSC students for the purpose of making our peers feel safer on campus.
With a single button the app will notify emergency services and emergency contacts that you are in danger.
At the same time it will record your location and phone camera in order to gain any meaningful information in the event of a catastrophe. 
Every action completed on this app will also send an incident report email to the phone of the person using the app.
